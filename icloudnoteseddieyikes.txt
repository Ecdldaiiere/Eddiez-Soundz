2/1/18:   Chasing cars by Snow Patrol. That’s all I wanted. “If I lay here. If I just lay here. Would you lie with me and just forget the world.” Ever since I was 10, I had this dream, this vision, of us on a hill overlooking the city. It’s at night, and we can hear the soft whoosh of cars passing at a distance. It’s a nice and cool night in Spring or Summer, 50 degrees, and we just lie on our backs next to each other. This vision is so powerful to me. And look at me now. 10 years later, and it hasn’t come true, despite how badly I wanted it. Now I’m writing this alone in the playground in this cool February 1st night, dreaming of you while you have completely forgotten about me. I’ve ran away from home because my parents are arguing again. I can’t even remember how many times I’ve ran away now, and it sucks that this neighborhood is so open that there’s no where to hide. No hidden place under a bridge or an outer edge or anything. No matter where you stand in this neighborhood, you are in the view of at least three peoples homes. I just no one bothers to ask what I’m doing in the middle of the night and that no police come. Life, huh?

2/1/18:   I’m a good person. I know I am. I just need someone to tell me my hearts in the right place.
